## ECE745 assignment 4

The purpose of this ECE745 assignment is to introduce you to fault simulation and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) algorithms for digital integrated circuits. The details are in the assignment 4 [document](doc/ece745-assignment4.pdf).

As for the previous assignments, some very basic template code is in the `atpg` sub-folder. The example input file from the assignment 4 [document](doc/ece745-assignment4.pdf) is available in the `input` sub-folder, together with a couple of additional test cases. The types of files automatically-generated by your program for the example from the assignment 4 [document](doc/ece745-assignment4.pdf) are in the `output` sub-folder. In the `utils` sub-folder you will find useful support material like an executable for a third-party SAT solver and how to use it directly from C with an user-controllable timeout, example of a testbench to be used for validation of your data structures for simulation, ... How to make the most of the material from this sub-folder will be discussed during class time in due time.

This assignment is worth 25% of your final grade and it is due before the end of day on July 30th. Your report should be not longer than two pages, nonetheless it must explain clearly your unique approach for pattern count reduction.
